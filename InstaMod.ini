custom flair body = Hey user! We're beta testing InstaMod bot for r/HomeworkHelp to recognise active contributors with an exclusive user flair. If you do not appreciate the user flair, please do not directly remove the flair from your user profile because you will be automatically re-flaired again in the next 30 days. This whole user flair system is completely untested. If you encounter any issues, please kindly let us know [here](https://rhomeworkhelp.typeform.com/c/NC2fk4).
